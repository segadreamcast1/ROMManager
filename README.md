# ROM Mod Manager
### The fastest FOSS mod manager with no ads

## What is ROM Mod Manager?

***ROM Mod Manager*** is an open-source, command-line interface (CLI) mod manager designed to provide a fast, lightweight, and user-friendly experience for managing mods across various games. Unlike traditional mod managers with bulky graphical interfaces, ***ROM Mod Manager*** leverages the power of the CLI for efficiency and simplicity, making it ideal for power users, developers, and gamers who prefer a streamlined approach. 

With a focus on flexibility and broad compatibility, ***ROM Mod Manager*** supports a wide array of games, particularly Unity-based titles. The mod list is fully customizable and can be [modified here](https://github.com/segadreamcast1/ROMModList), allowing users to add their own mods and manage them with ease.

### Upcoming Features:
